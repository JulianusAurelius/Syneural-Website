This is a private website that only the CIO (Chief Information Officer) of the company should access.
I am designing these forms to fulfill the UI requirements in my CIS250 class

The report website is used to create reports from the databases to show trends
The blend website is used to delete, add, and maintain blend mixtures

The login website is here, as I would have to add even more js and more code to make my homepage work with it,
which would be very tedious
