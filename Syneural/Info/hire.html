            <h2>Please Read Before Applying</h2>
            <h3>Who Should Apply</h3>
            <p>We have set out some general guidelines about who should apply</p>
            <p>1. Someone who is looking for more than just a job. This is for people who want to make a 
                difference</p>
            <p>2. Someone who is willing to go above and beyond. I make this company my passion, and everday
                I work hard and live a dream. Be willing to make this your passion, and love what you do, and do 
                what you love</p>
            <p>3. "That's not in the Job Description", a phrase I don't use. Our small company size requires 
                that we go above our positions and titles. I may be Founder and CEO, but I do a bit of the cyber
                requirements, a lot of financials, product testing, marketing, and just about everything else. I 
                don't ask that people do as much as I do, but someone applying should be willing to do more than 
                just their position when needed</p> <!--I DON'T WANNA MAKE THIS SOUND DICKISH AND SOUND
                LIKE WE'LL MAKE YOU DO WHATEVER. HOW TO FIX?-->
            <p>4. The exact level of education does not matter. It will help, but regardless, we will take all 
                learning done seriously, whether it was just free online (Like Codecedemy) or at a University. 
                Please only apply if you feel you could perform the general requirements of the job, but you do 
                not have to possess 15 PhDs. No matter your level of education, whether or not you went to college, 
                please apply. For example, Sales, you don't need years of experience and a degree. While both will 
                help on their own, as long as you feel you are social enough and persistant enough, feel free to 
                contact us.</p>
            <p>5. It is preferred that you care about either health, food, being outdoors, or anything in the 
                general nature of our product. Our team is not just passionate about our company, but our product 
                itself. We love our product and no one adopts our products faster than us.</p>
            <h3>Application Process and Timeline</h3>
            <p>So the business will not be launched until 2024, so if you apply, please know you are being seriously 
                considered for the team, and you should only apply if you are highly interested in this job, and 
                still will be by 2024</p>
            <p>2021 - We will start to go through applications and reach out to develop our team. At this point, 
                only nutritionists, web developers, and a few other key positions will start work</p>
            <p>2022 - As we start to prototype our product, all other positions will start work and start 
                developing specific plans</p>
            <p>2023 - All positions will hopefully be filled, our team will be hard at work preparing for our 
                launch the next year</p>
            <p>2024 - Launch! At this point everyone's doing their job and we're working hard!</p>
            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <p>Please know all this information is preliminary, but we strive to compensate our employees as 
                best we can</p>
            <p>The exact salary will be determined as part of the secondary interviews, however, we have plenty 
                of other benefits that we would love to include for our employees</p>
            <p>1. Work from Home. Don't worry about gas, time on the road, or parking! Work from home! (Note: If 
                you feel you are unable to work from home due to technology issues, please continue to apply, we 
                might be able to work around that and work with you)</p>
            <p>2. Surreal! We are a food company specializing in the healthiest food on the planet of the highest 
                quality. Not only that, we love to take care of our employees! Put the two together and guess what! 
                You get any of our products at pretty much free! Imagine having a few extra thousand in your pocket 
                each year from not buying groceries!</p>
            <p>3. Get a wide range of skills in business. If this isn't a bonus for you, then you probably won't 
                enjoy working with us as much. You'll get to do a little bit of everything, even if you're in 
                accounting you'll get to see a bit of sales and product development. Don't be stifled to doing 
                the same thing over and over again mindlessly, day in day out.</p>
            <p>4. We are also very personal, it's a family. Your ideas will actually be heard the moment you 
                say them, instead of getting lost somewhere in the corporate ladder</p>
            <p>5. We try to partner with health and fitness companies to try and get company discounts at 
                specific places. While these will often change and many are in the works, we try to help our 
                employees enjoy their towns and communities, and help them save a dime or two in doing so!</p>
            <p>We have lots of other benefits, but in general, we just try to be a good company and good people</p>
