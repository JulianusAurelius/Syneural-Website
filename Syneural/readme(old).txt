For CIS250:

(You can open up with index.html or go to the Profile folder and open up any of the HTML files)
The 3 profile pages each have a website attached to them. You can click on each input and modify it,
when you press submit it will reset the page, however, I have not developed the code to save
any modified input.
After looking at each of those pages, you can open up the CIS250 folder and launch any of the HTML elements,
they all have links to eachother. Each button at the top of the screen has a function behind it to
bring up different info or forms. 
Thank you for taking the time to explore the site,
-Julian
